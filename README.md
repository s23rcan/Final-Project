# Final-Project

The objective was to practice a number of different things learned throughout the Cybersecurity bootcamp course and to act as a Pen Tester and SOC Analyst.

Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.
Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.
Read through the Red Team, Blue Team and Network Analysis files to the see the work, process and findings that lead up to creation of the final presetation.

View the final Google slide project presentation here. Note: This presentation was created as a group with classmates. However, all other documentation for Red Team, Blue Team and Network Analysis was my own personal work. We were only assigned to be a team to bring our findings together to create a group presentation and present together on the final day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
